# Output Templates

Four templates for different tasks and levels of detail.

---

## 1. Creative Concept One-Pager

Template for presenting a single idea with full development. Used when you need to elaborate on a specific concept in one document.

```
# [CONCEPT NAME]

## Insight
[One sentence: the audience wants X, but Y prevents them, because Z]

## Idea
[One sentence — the essence of the concept]

## Tagline
[If applicable]

## Key Visual / Hero Execution
[Description: what the person sees in the first 3 seconds]

## How It Lives
- [Channel 1]: [what specifically happens]
- [Channel 2]: [what specifically happens]
- [Channel 3]: [what specifically happens]

## 3 Executions
1. [Name]: [description in 2-3 lines]
2. [Name]: [description in 2-3 lines]
3. [Name]: [description in 2-3 lines]

## Evaluation
- Score (weighted): X.X / 10
- HumanKind: X / 10
- Grey: [level]
- Rationale: [2-3 lines — why this score, strengths and weaknesses]
```

Filling rules:
- Insight strictly follows the formula "wants X, but Y, because Z."
- Key Visual describes a specific frame or scene, not an abstract mood.
- Evaluation includes rationale — without it, scores are meaningless.

## 2. Top-3 Presentation Format

The primary working template for responding to a creative brief. Three ideas with scores, discarded directions, a recommendation, and a process description.

```
# CREATIVE BRIEF RESPONSE

## Brief (in a paragraph)
[Product/brand, target audience, objective, constraints, channels — in one paragraph]

## Insight
[Format: the audience wants X, but Y prevents them, because Z]

## Tension
[Cultural / category / human tension]

---

## IDEA #1: [NAME] — Recommendation

**Concept:** [one sentence]
**Visualization:** [what it looks like]
**Media/Channels:** [where it lives]
**Tagline:** [if applicable]

**Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Originality | X.X |
| Strategic Fit | X.X |
| Emotional Response | X.X |
| Feasibility | X.X |
| Scalability | X.X |
| Simplicity | X.X |
| **Weighted Score** | **X.X** |
| HumanKind | X |
| Grey | [level] |

**Rationale:** [why this score]

---

## IDEA #2: [NAME]
[same structure]

---

## IDEA #3: [NAME]
[same structure]

---

## Discarded Directions
- [Direction 1]: [why discarded, 1 line]
- [Direction 2]: [why discarded, 1 line]

## Recommendation
[Which idea to develop, why, what's needed for the next step]

## Process
- Methods: [which were used]
- Recursion passes: [how many]
- Stop reason: [9+ threshold / max passes / plateau]
```

Filling rules:
- Idea #1 is always marked as the recommendation. If another is recommended — change the order.
- Tension is separate from insight. Insight is about the audience, tension is about the context.
- Discarded directions — at least two. The "Process" section records methods and iterations.

---

## 3. Campaign Platform

Template for a strategic campaign platform. Used when the task requires a systemic approach: architecture, channel matrix, results measurement.

```
# CAMPAIGN PLATFORM: [NAME]

## Strategic Foundation
- Objective: [business + communication]
- Insight: [formula]
- Territory: [creative territory]
- Positioning: [one sentence]

## Concept
- Big Idea: [one sentence]
- Tagline: [if applicable]
- Visual Language: [description of the visual world]
- Tone of Voice: [3-4 adjectives + example phrase]

## Campaign Architecture
| Level | Idea | Channels |
|-------|------|----------|
| Big Idea | [X] | All |
| Campaign Idea #1 | [Y] | [channels] |
| Campaign Idea #2 | [Z] | [channels] |
| Key Executions | [list] | [specific formats] |

## Execution Matrix
| Channel | Format | Essence | KPI |
|---------|--------|---------|-----|
| [channel] | [format] | [what happens] | [metric] |

## Measurement
- Awareness: [how to measure]
- Engagement: [how to measure]
- Conversion: [how to measure]
- Brand Lift: [how to measure]

## Evaluation
[Score / HumanKind / Grey + rationale]
```

Filling rules:
- Strategic foundation comes first. Without it, the concept has no foundation.
- Execution Matrix is a practical plan. Each row must be actionable.
- Tone of Voice includes an example phrase — without an example, adjectives remain vague.

---

## 4. Quick Brief Response

A lightweight format for quick tasks: social media post, simple layout, short message. Five concepts with scores and a recommendation.

```
## Brief: [short task description]

## Insight: [one sentence]

## 5 Concepts:

1. **[Name]**: [description in 1-2 lines] | Score: X.X
2. **[Name]**: [description in 1-2 lines] | Score: X.X
3. **[Name]**: [description in 1-2 lines] | Score: X.X
4. **[Name]**: [description in 1-2 lines] | Score: X.X
5. **[Name]**: [description in 1-2 lines] | Score: X.X

## Recommendation: [number] — [why]
```

Filling rules:
- Brief in one line. If the task requires more — use the Top-3 template.
- Five concepts, not three. The quick format compensates for brevity with quantity.
- Recommendation is mandatory. Without it, a list of concepts is not an answer, it's a menu.

## Template Selection

| Situation | Template |
|-----------|----------|
| Full creative brief | Top-3 Presentation |
| Presenting a single idea | Concept One-Pager |
| Strategic platform / major campaign | Campaign Platform |
| Post, banner, simple task | Quick Brief Response |

If the task doesn't fit exactly into any format — use Top-3 as the base and adapt to context.
