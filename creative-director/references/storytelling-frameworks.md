# Narrative Frameworks for Advertising

Six working structures for building stories in advertising formats. Each framework is a ready-to-use template, not theory. Apply directly to the brief.

### 1. Story Spine (Kenn Adams / Pixar)

**Author:** Kenn Adams, popularized by Pixar
**Essence:** An eight-line template that forces the story to move through cause-and-effect links. Each line flows from the previous one, eliminating random turns and loose logic. The fastest way to assemble a narrative from scratch.
**Structure:**
1. Once upon a time... (the hero and their world)
2. Every day... (routine, status quo)
3. But one day... (the inciting incident, a break from the familiar)
4. Because of that... (first consequence)
5. Because of that... (second consequence, escalation)
6. Because of that... (third consequence, peak tension)
7. Until finally... (climax, resolution)
8. And ever since... (the new normal)

**Timing for advertising:**
- 15 sec: only lines 3-7. Enter straight from the conflict, exit at the resolution. No time for exposition.
- 30 sec: full template. Lines 1-2 take 5-7 seconds, the main chain — 15-18 seconds, the finale — 5-7 seconds.
- 60 sec: expand the "because of that" chain to 4-5 links. Each link is a separate scene with escalation.

**Example:** 30-second dishwashing detergent spot. "Every day Maria spent an hour on dishes. But one day she tried X. Because of that, dishes took ten minutes. Because of that, evenings became free. And ever since, evenings belong to her." The brand enters at line 3, the benefit unfolds through the chain of consequences.
**When to use:** when you need to quickly assemble a structure for any format and ensure every plot turn is logically justified.

### 2. Sparkline (Nancy Duarte — "Resonate")

**Author:** Nancy Duarte, book "Resonate"
**Essence:** Rhythmic alternation between "what is" (current reality, pain) and "what could be" (a better future). Each switch amplifies the contrast and engagement. The finale is a bridge between two worlds, where the brand becomes the guide from one state to the other.
**Structure:**
1. What is (current pain, a recognizable situation)
2. What could be (the first glimmer of possibility)
3. What is (deeper pain, specifics)
4. What could be (a clearer vision of the future)
5. New reality (the bridge — the brand as the one making the transition possible)

**Timing for advertising:**
- 15 sec: one switch. "What is" — 5 sec, "what could be" — 7 sec, brand — 3 sec.
- 30 sec: two switches. A building rhythm of contrasts.
- 60 sec: full sparkline with 3-4 switches. Each cycle deepens both the pain and the hope.

**Example:** Always #LikeAGirl. Alternation between what girls hear about themselves (limitations, stereotypes) and who they can be (strength, confidence). Each switch intensifies the tension. The brand reveals the final shift — redefining the phrase "like a girl" from an insult into strength.
**When to use:** for campaigns related to behavior change, social impact, brand manifestos, and any content where you need to show the contrast between problem and solution.

### 3. Freytag's Pyramid

**Author:** Gustav Freytag, 19th century
**Essence:** The classic five-act dramatic arc. Works for any story that needs an emotional climax. The main rule: no climax — no memorability. A spot without a peak moment is forgotten instantly.
**Structure:**
1. Exposition (world, characters, context)
2. Rising action (complications accumulate, stakes rise)
3. Climax (peak moment, turning point)
4. Falling action (consequences, realization)
5. Dénouement (new normal + brand)

**Timing for advertising:**
- 15 sec: climax at the 8-10 second mark. Exposition compressed to 3-4 seconds. Dénouement — 2-3 seconds with the brand.
- 30 sec: climax at the 18-22 second mark. Time for proper rising action and emotional falling action.
- 60 sec: full pyramid with full-scale build-up. Exposition up to 15 seconds, rising action up to 20, climax 5-8, falling action and dénouement 15-20.

**Example:** John Lewis Christmas ads. Full Freytag's Pyramid: introduction to the character, escalation of emotional tension through a series of scenes, emotional climax seconds before the brand appears, a gentle dénouement. The brand appears during the falling action, when the viewer is maximally vulnerable.
**When to use:** for traditional narrative spots where there's a production budget and duration of 30 seconds or more, especially for emotional storytelling and brand image advertising.

### 4. Monroe's Motivated Sequence

**Author:** Alan Monroe, 1930s
**Essence:** A persuasion structure built for action. Doesn't just tell a story but leads the viewer to a specific step. Each stage is a funnel step: from attention to need, from solution to visualization of the outcome and call to action.
**Structure:**
1. Attention (hook — a shocking fact, question, micro-story)
2. Need (identify the problem, make it personal)
3. Satisfaction (present the solution — product/brand)
4. Visualization (show life with the solution)
5. Action (clear CTA)

**Timing for advertising:**
- 15 sec: only attention + need + action. Three beats: hook, pain, CTA. The solution is implied through the brand.
- 30 sec: all 5 stages in compressed form. Visualization — one vivid scene.
- 60 sec: full sequence with an extended visualization. The visualization stage can take up to 15-20 seconds — this is the key moment where the viewer "tries on" the result.

**Example:** Charity: Water. Attention — a child walks kilometers for water. Need — millions lack clean water, diseases, child mortality. Satisfaction — well technology, a simple solution. Visualization — a thriving village, children in school, clean water from the tap. Action — "Donate now, $30 provides one person with water for life."
**When to use:** for direct response advertising, fundraising, infomercials, and any format where the end goal is a specific viewer action right now.

### 5. Pixar Rules (Top 7 for Advertising)

**Author:** Pixar team, collected by Emma Coats
**Essence:** Not a structure, but a quality checklist. Use after writing a script or concept. Seven rules from the full Pixar list most applicable to advertising. Run every finished script through this filter.
**Structure (checklist):**
1. "You admire a character for trying more than for their successes" — show the struggle, not just the result. Struggle creates empathy.
2. "What is your character good at? Throw the polar opposite at them" — create conflict through contrast. The character's comfort zone is their vulnerability.
3. "Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle" — know the punchline in advance. Write from the ending to the beginning.
4. "Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours" — especially critical for short formats. Every frame must work.
5. "What is the essence of your story? The most economical telling of it?" — the golden question for 15-second formats. If you can't say it in one sentence, the plot is loose.
6. "Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th" — serial order effect. The first ideas are clichés. The real work begins after the fifth iteration.
7. "Give your characters opinions. Passive and malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it's poison to the audience" — a character with a position is memorable. A neutral character is invisible.

**Timing for advertising:** applied to any format as a post-check. Doesn't directly affect duration.
**Example:** Checking a Nike spot script. Rule 1 — is the athlete's struggle shown, not just the finish? Rule 4 — can a scene be removed without losing meaning? Rule 6 — is this the first idea or the tenth? If the script passes all 7 filters, it's ready for production.
**When to use:** after creating any script or concept as a final quality control before client presentation.

### 6. Hero's Journey (Customer = Hero, Brand = Guide)

**Author:** Joseph Campbell, advertising adaptation — Donald Miller (StoryBrand)
**Essence:** A condensed version of the monomyth for advertising. Key principle: the customer is the hero, the brand is the guide. A brand that makes itself the hero loses the audience. The customer doesn't want to admire the brand — they want the brand to help them become a better version of themselves.
**Structure:**
1. Ordinary world (the customer's current life, their context)
2. Call to adventure (a problem or opportunity that disrupts the status quo)
3. Meeting the guide (the brand appears — NOT as the hero, but as a mentor, tool, helper)
4. Crossing the threshold (the customer tries the product/service, takes the first step)
5. Transformation (life has changed, the customer is different)
6. Return with the gift (new status quo, ability to share the story)

**Timing for advertising:**
- 30 sec: only steps 1, 2, 4, 5. Skip the explicit brand-as-guide appearance (it's visible through the product at step 4) and the return.
- 60 sec: full journey in condensed form. Each step — 8-10 seconds. Step 3 (meeting the guide) is the most delicate: the brand must appear unobtrusively.

**Example:** Nike — the athlete is always the hero, Nike is the tool that helps them overcome themselves. Apple — the creative person is the hero, Apple is the tool that removes barriers between idea and execution. In both cases, the brand never puts itself at the center. It spotlights the customer.
**When to use:** for brand image campaigns where the brand wants to build a long-term emotional connection with the audience through the position of a mentor, not a contender for attention.
